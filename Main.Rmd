This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Problem: Let coin A have an H probability of 0.2, and let coin B have an H probability of 0.8. This is a simulation for determining the optimal number of flips in order to deliver the highest sensitivity at a particular threshhold for the probability of success.
```



```{r}

```{r}
#Declare parameters

bins <- 50

```
```{r}
#Obtain the number of A and B coins based on a single sample of a 100-sample Binomial distribution (ie. how many A coins in 100 trials, assuming each coin is equally likely to be picked)
set.seed(100)

```{r}
#Flip each coin 10 times and compute the maximum likelihood of the observation

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
